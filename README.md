# FictionalCompany  Project WebAPI

FictionalCompany is a main Core Rest API developed by using SDK 7.0

i have used Entity FrameWork for the Adding, Updating, Delating and getting users. and used Code First approch where database will create automatically. for this i have used Migrations. 

used 4 classes 

1. AddUserRequest.cs
2. UpdateUserRequest.cs
3. UserContext.cs
4. Users

# Users.cs ia a main user object. and i have used different classes for adding and updating the user details. 

# Used Developer Contoller for the curd operations.

# UserContext.cs class is a class to connect dbContext.

## Deploment

I have used my personal server to demonistrate the API. 

for security reason i am not providing url here. you will get it in email.

writing code is much easier then deploment 




# Freelance user interface.

for now just ignore this. i have done something and not completed becoause lack of time since in my office there is deploment in this month so working extra hours. but i can do it if i have a time. also mentioned in the test this is an option. so i dont think this can be a nagative impact on me.
